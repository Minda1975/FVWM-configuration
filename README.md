# FVWM-configuration
My FVWM configuration, that mimics the look of wmaker.
You also need to install following applications to have a fully working dock and some functions: `wmcpuload wmsystemtray wmmemload  wmMoonClock wmclockmon fbxkb volumeicon suckless-tools  liberation-fonts-ttf rxvt-unicode xsettingsd lxappearance lxtask xfce4-terminal thunar xfce4-notifyd`. I also using zsh shell, with [powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k). If you want to be productive, i recommend installing it.
